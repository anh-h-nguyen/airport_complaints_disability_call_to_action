# ✈️ Airport Accessibility Complaint Analysis on Power BI  

## Technologies Used  
- Data Visualization Tool: Power BI Desktop  
- User Interface: Interactive dashboard with clickable buttons  
- Dataset: Airport complaint data related to accessibility issues  

## Project Overview  
Airports are essential travel hubs, but accessibility issues create challenges for passengers with disabilities. This project visualizes airport-related complaints from individuals with disabilities, highlighting trends in wheelchair accessibility, medical supply handling, and mobility support.  

Designed for the National Disability Rights Annual Conference, this interactive Power BI dashboard enables attendees to explore complaint trends and take direct action to advocate for better accessibility policies.  

## Purpose  
The goal of this project is to raise awareness and inspire action regarding accessibility challenges at airports. Key features include:  
- Complaint volume analysis by airport, category, and time period  
- Insights into specific accessibility concerns affecting travelers  
- Direct engagement option**—attendees can fill out a form to send pre-written letters to airport executives at the top five airports with the highest complaints  

By using clear and actionable insights, this initiative encourages policy improvements and stronger inclusivity measures in air travel.  

## Medium  
This interactive Power BI presentation is designed to:  
- Allow smooth navigation: users click buttons to switch between insights  
- Focus on essential data: the presentation is limited to two pages for clarity  
- Enable direct advocacy: a pre-written letter submission feature lets attendees contact airport officials easily  

## Design Approach  
The dashboard follows Gestalt’s Principle of Similarity, ensuring a consistent layout with visuals aligned for clarity:  
- Visual Structure: Two charts on top, one larger visualization at the bottom  
- Color Psychology: A blue-themed palette representing aviation and professionalism  
- Readability: Well-organized text and visuals for quick audience engagement  

These design choices help create an intuitive, informative experience for conference attendees.  

## Ethical Considerations  
- Preserving dataset integrity: original complaint data remains unchanged, with additional columns added for clarity (month/year extraction).  
- Recognizing potential biases: complaints rely on provided categories, and misclassification risks exist.  
- Transparency on complaint volume increases: acknowledging TSA’s statement that submission processes have been simplified, potentially increasing recorded complaints.  
- Help Button Integration: audience members can access data sources and review methodology for additional context.  

## Future Improvements  
- Expand dataset scope: include additional years and regional breakdowns for broader analysis.  
- Enhance interactivity: allow audience members to filter by airport or complaint type.  
- Develop an advocacy resource hub: provide materials for continued outreach beyond the conference.  
- Improve accessibility in the dashboard: ensure compatibility with screen readers and adaptive technologies.  

## Call to Action  
- Attendees can submit pre-written letters to airport executives to push for policy changes.  
- Interactive data provides compelling insights to drive advocacy efforts.  
- Supporting accessibility improvements ensures more inclusive air travel for all.
